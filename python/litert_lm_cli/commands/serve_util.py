  """Retrieves the persistent server engine or initializes it on first request.

  Lifetime Management:
  The LiteRT-LM Engine is a globally scoped persistent resource attached
  directly to explicit runtime properties on the custom server context object.
  - Initialization: Invokes `__enter__` dynamically upon the arrival of the
    first incoming inference request.
  - Termination: The running server's parent execution process is responsible
    for explicitly invoking `__exit__` on `server.litert_lm_engine` during outer
    context teardown loops (e.g., in `run_server` finally blocks).

  Args:
    server: The active custom LiteRTLMServer instance object.
    model_id: The requested model identifier string.

  Returns:
    The shared LiteRT-LM Engine context object.

  Raises:
    FileNotFoundError: If the model package path does not exist.
    RuntimeError: If a different model ID is requested after initialization.
